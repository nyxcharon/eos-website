			  <b>Embers of Solace</b> is a 2D mmorpg that also features an offline campaign. It tells the story of the rise and fall of a great empire, and what happens to those who survived.
			  The online portion of this game features no classes. Often in MMOs we see grinding for equipment, when the real focus should be on the game play and story. That is what the game should be  about; the story and how you experience it, not having the best equipment. This is what we are striving to achieve.
			</p>
			<br>
			  <p>Embers of Solace is still under heavy development and design. Expect gameplay and screenshots as we continue to work hard on the game. For  more information on the basic premise of the game, keep reading
			  </p>
			  <br>
			    <br>
			      <p>
				<b>Classless</b><br>
				  A lot of games have predefined classes for you to pick from; healer, tank, berserker, etc. Some games even let you learn a couple skills or abilities from another class. In EoS, classes are not a thing. You start the same as every single other person. You are free to pick and choose what skills you learn. If still want to just focus on learning magic and healing people, you can. However, If you want to dabble in a little bit of everything instead, that's perfectly acceptable as well. Or maybe you want to specialize in healing and combat, and become a one man army? All of these are different possibilities that you can choose in EoS.
				</p>
				<br>
				  <p>
				    <b>Skills and Combat</b><br>
				      As you can imagine, there is a wide array of skills and abilities for you to learn in EoS. If you following a single path long enough, you might even find yourself learning from a Master of that skill. Train with them long enough, and you too might have the opportunity to become a master and train others. In terms of gameplay, you can expect both open world questing, as well as some instances. Raids and quest will take form in both, so don't be surprised if you leave a city one day only to find a large beast being attacked by a plethora of people outside. 
				    </p>
				    <br>
				      <p>
					<b>Leveless</b><br>
					  Very often in games, especially in MMO's, we see levels as barriers. Barriers keeping us from the next dungeon, or equipping our new gear. They also tend to create a seperation; only high level players associate with high level players, etc.That's why EoS doesn't have levels.<br>
					    <i>But how in the world does that work? </i><br>
						  It's simple. Every character in EoS has a respect, trust and infamy attribute associated with them. The more people trust and respect you, the more they'll let you do. The more people begin to respect you, the higher your infamy is. The higher that attribute, the more likely people are to respect and trust you when you first meet them. So, building (and breaking) realtionships will be a vital part to your survival in EoS.
						</p>
						<br>
						  <p>  
						    <b>Roles and Storyline</b><br>
						      <i> What is all this fuss about multiple story lines?</i>
							  A lot of games focus on telling a single, large main story while throwing in some occasionally side quest. Not EoS. Again, we like to re-iterate that when you play EoS, you decide you're own story. The overall main story is dictated by everyone as a whole. People from different backgrounds and experience must band together to accomplish what must get done. Some people will choose to join the army. Other's might simply become a mercenary. You can even become a blacksmith or a merchant if you wanted too. In EoS, you only have to be the Hero if you want to, but know that your decisions will have an impact on you and others. If you find building your own market empire more interesting instead, no one will stop you. Well, maybe a couple people might try actually...
							</p>
							<br>
							  <p>
							    <b>Market and Gear</b><br>

							      Which brings us the Markets and Gear. A lot of games have a player controlled market. Most games implement it terribly. When someone gets that rare drop that no one has ever heard about, it has a tendency to go for a ridiculous price, which affects the global economy, especially for higher priced items. We've experienced multiple games where the price for gear for end game levels is so high, it's not actually possible to buy any of it without a) A LOT of grinding and some luck or b) illegally buying gold. We think that's stupid. That's why it will be controlled to some extent by the local player ran government in each providence. So, if one market starts price gouging a item, you're free to go somewhere else without having to worry about it too much. 
							    </p>
							    <br>
							      
							      <p>

								We realize this doesn't go very in depth and that you probably have questions. We understand, and we'll slowly be reveling more and more about EoS as we see fit.
